CHAPTER LOCATIONS

##### STORY POINTS

The [[Maws]] were a part of the [[Wrassa]] organism, which fed upon stars, and assimilated the life it encountered into its hive mind.

Disconnected from its Brain and Nerual Nodes, the [[Maws]] became a safe form of intersteller travel for people after the fall of the [[Starlight Imperium]].

An AF Quarantine device attached to a [[Wrassa]] Neural Node is deactivated. This node awakens, and the [[Null AF Zone]] around it vanishes. It assimilates the crew and vessel of the exploration starship [[Dark Vector]].

The [[Dark Vector]] Node (DVN) starts to build a population of motiles by attacking settlements and abducting citizens. It takes over and assimilates a self-sustaining corporate shipyard orbiting a remote planetoid, and houses new motiles there.

The life forms now inhabiting this star cluster attempt to protect their vital settlements and resources, but their military is small and insufficient to track and destroy the stealthy DVN.

CHAPTER 0: Slumbering Corsairius detects [[Wrassa]] threat, and sends out signals to nearby persons its scans have identified as potential Corsairs.

DVN detects signals that match the signature of the [[Starlight Imperium]] ship that had disabled it eons ago: Corsairius. It investigates the destinations of the signals, attacking and collecting more motiles as it does so. It is unable to investigate the source of the signal, as it keeps moving.

DVN now has two imperitives:

1: Reestablish contact with the central Brain.

2: Eliminate the threat to [[Wrassa]] that is Corsairius.

DVN ascertains identity of Corsairius signal recipients(PCs), and follows them to the ancient battleship. It sends motiles to board and capture the ship, but the motiles are defeated by signal recipients.

CHAPTER 1: PCs defeat [[Dark Vector]] crew aboard Corsairius.

DVN returns to assimilated shipyard to recrew and build more ships.

CHAPTER 2: PCs find and reitrieve Corsair Battle Frames.

DVN knows it needs the resources of its old organs, both to defeat Corsairius and to reconnect with [[Wrassa]], but its connection to those organs had been severed by the Imperium's AF Quarantine device. To repair the connection, DVN decides it must enter [[Wrassa]] through a Maw, and find a Construction & Repair Organ. All motiles leave the shipyard, and go with DVN to the Maw.

[[Dark Vector]] Node kills or assimilates all life forms in and around the [[Trisolar Maw]], and destroys the [[IPF]] battleships protecting it, when they tried to stop it from entering.

Several replicas of [[Dark Vector]] ship are crewed and sent to attack settlements as diversion.

Chapter 3: PCs defeat [[Dark Vector]] replicas, and find DVN's assimilated shipyard abandoned.

Once [[Dark Vector]] Node's connection to [[Wrassa]] body is reestablished, it still has no connection with the Brain. The pathway is severed.

[[Dark Vector]] Node finds and gains control of a Construction & Repair Organ, repairs its extradimensional connections to the [[Maws]], and begins building new vessels; the same weapons it once used to fight the [[Starlight Imperium]]. It builds up these forces inside the Maw, and lays in wait for Corsairius to fall into the trap.

Chapter 4: PCs defeat DVN's forces in the Maw, and are contacted by Imperium remnants.

DVN must now reach the Brain of [[Wrassa]] in real space, to determine whether it still exists and can be recovered. It knows where in the brain is, but the starcharts it has obtained on the [[Dark Vector]] indicate that it too is contained within a [[Null AF Zone]].

DVN cannot travel into Null AF Space, because its connection will again be severed. However, many its new motiles can operate independantly for extended periods, thanks to their previous exposure to the [[Maws]]. DVN travels the warrens of [[Wrassa]] and exits the nearest Maw to the [[Wrassa]] Brain.

DVN leaves the [[Dark Vector]] for a safe hiding spot, and sends a single [[motile]] - the ship's old captain - into the [[Null AF Zone]] to disable the Brain's AF Quarantine device.

Chapter 5: PCs confront Captain _____ aboard the [[Dark Vector]] at the site of the [[Wrassa]] Brain.

[[Wrassa]] Brain dies, but DVN lives on, now reconnected to the body of [[Wrassa]], to grow into a new Brain.
