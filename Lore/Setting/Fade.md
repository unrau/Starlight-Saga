The concept of the soul was more scientifically described - in the time of the Imperium - as an organ, called the Fade, and is made of Hephasic Quanta.

Technologies or events related to shades are described as Hephasic, Phasic, or Phase.

## Relationship with Arcana
Each Fade is like a pool of Arcanic energy. Channelling the Arcane Field is like connecting the pool to the ocean that was its source. See [[Arcanic Sciences]].
