What many still refer to as magic is known more commonly as Arcana (Arcanic): the scientific field concerning the study and exploitation of the [[Arcane Field]].

Technology that utilizes the [[arcane field]] is commonly referred to as "AF Tech" or just "AF". Examples:

"These AF readings are off the charts"

"AF Radio", "AF Comms"

"Dead Magic Zones? They're called Null AF Zones now, dumbass."

AF tech has widespread use in various applications, including weapons, defense, communication, and entertainment.

Different governments have varying laws and restrictions governing the use and study of AF tech.

The [[Arcane Field]] is heavily influenced by gravity, such that the effects of spells can differ greatly between zero; low; or high gravity environments. As such, many AF devices contain gravity sensors with automatic adjustors or kill switches that change function depending on the gravity level.
