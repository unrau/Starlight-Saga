Undeath is an idiomatic characterization of the process known scientifically as Metamorphic Necrogenesis, whereby the decay process of a living organism is overridden and serves as the gestation of a new life form, usually preserving a semblence of the progenitor organism. Many forms of metamorphic Necrogenesis exist, from parasites, to fungi, to engineered or natural arcanic phenomena. Necromorphs usually subsist on some form of animatic quanta, such as blood.
