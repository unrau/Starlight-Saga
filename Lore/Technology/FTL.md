Conventional FTL, or simply "FTL", is the common technology used by starships to transit space at speeds faster than light. It is appropriate for intersystem travel, and travel to nearby systems, but intergalactic distances take much too long.

An FTL drive allows mass - such as that of a starship - to be pulled along the currents in the AF Field. The higher the mass, the slower the speed. 

The average maximum speed in FTL for small to medium sized transports is about 0.5% of [[Super Speed]], or 449,376,216 km/s.

An FTL drive works by charging the hull of a vessel with AF energy, which grants it a very limited measure of friction against the energy flows of the [[Arcane Field]], allowing the vessel to ride these currents. Skimming the membrane of the [[Arcane Field]] in this manner, like so many AF Tech exploits, allws us to bypass certain laws of subluminal space; in this case the speed limit of 1c.

While the ship is charged for FTL, the inverted nature of superluminal gravitational waves protects the ship to a degree, pushing away small debris. This is called an FTL Wake, and it is standard practise to keep a ship "awake" while it is free-floating, even when stationary. This quality of superluminal waves also affects the ship's relationship to gravity wells in subluminal space; gravitational forces push against the vessel instead of pulling it in. Therefore, the larger the mass of an approaching stellar body, the further away you must exit FTL.
