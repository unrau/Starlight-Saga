The Arcane Field is the quantum membrane between subluminal space and superluminal space. The manipulation of this membrane is the source of most every power that once claimed the label of "magic".

##### Further Explanation
Subluminal and Superluminal space occupy the same 3 dimensions, but particles in one cannot interact with the other; light-speed is the maximum speed of a particle in subluminal space, and is the minimum speed in superluminal space. Waves, however, do interact across the Arcane Field. The creation and manipulation of arcane waves is the principle method of affecting the environment which has often been called magic, and is the cornerstone of almost all advanced technology.

Effects applied to the Arcane Field are perpetuated across the field at the square of the speed of light, or [[Super Speed]]. This is the method used for most non-local communications, but it is easily intercepted, and easy to jam.

The vast majority of energy in the universe exists in superluminal space, such that it is an effectively infinite source of clean power. All electronics, from the largest planet-busting weapons to the tiniest subdermal implants, are trivially powered by the Arcane Field.
