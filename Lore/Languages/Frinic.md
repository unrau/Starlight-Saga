Frinic a universal language made possible by a microscopic parasitic organism that can be found in the brains of most sapient life forms. The knowledge it imparts in a mind lays dormant until its host first travels faster than the speed of light, and then it is understood and spoken instinctively. The language has no standard writing system of its own, but rather every civilization uses its own alphabet.
