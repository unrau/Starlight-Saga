[[Urutism]] was the work of the first [[Star Emperor]], Urute Vante. It is founded on these principles, which have remained sacrosanct and unbroken throughout the entire history of the [[Starlight Imperium]]:

1. Far Thought
	-   To think in scopes from near to far, prioritising the distant future
	-   Multi-generaltional planning
	-   Starting things that you, and perhaps many generations, will not see the completion of

2. Secure Foundation
	-   That everyone should be safe from their way of life being disrupted
	-   That all citizens participate in the military and productive forces that sustain the Imperium

3. Dialectic Discovery
	-   Like Dialectical Materialism
	-   That scientific pursuit of knowledge, whether physical, arcane, social, or individual, is the only path to truth.
	-   That myth is anethema to truth, and is reserved for the realm of knowledge lost or yet undiscovered, or for the realm of entertainment fiction.
