The three Corsairius Class Battle Platforms were the final and ultimate weapon created by the [[Starlight Imperium]] to end the existential threat of the [[Wrassa]].

Each Corsairius consists of a central tower-like vessel, with a ring of advanced battle-frames at the tower's keel, surrounding the tower's primary thruster cone.

The officers who pilot these battle-frames are called Corsairs.

The captain of the Corsairius is also the commander of its Corsair squadron, and has the title of Corsair General.

Ships of the Corsairius Class:
- [[Agency of Thought]]
- [[Might of Myriad]]
- [[Dream of Imperium]]
