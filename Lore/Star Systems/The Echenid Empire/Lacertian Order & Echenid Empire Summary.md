### The Lacertian Order, and Dragons
Dragons are like the Jedi of the empire. All dragons (or nearly all) are members of a peace-loving and inquisitive monastic order (Lacertian Order) that the empire uses as its peacekeepers and police. Dragons are raised from birth to take great care with their power and potential. They must serve on missions to shapeshift and integrate for long periods into other cultures, so that they can gain a deep understanding of other cultural contexts. They are natural diplomats, skilled at defusing hostilities. They are also naturally tied to the Arcane Field, and can weild its power to an extremely potent degree. The Lacertian view of the arcane field is somewhat more dogmatic, as it is deeply tied to the dragons' own myths. It could be that this viewpoint is just as true as the more scientific approach, viewed from a different cultural context.

The main military fighting force of the Echenid Empire is Kobolds. Hailing from their homeworld of Kobold, they are bred and trained for battle. They are like Star Wars' clone troopers. Some Kobolds, or groups of Kobolds, leave the empire and become mercineries. Kobold soldiers are prized outside the empire as elite fighters, and to have their service is a high status symbol; to control the feared weapon of the feared Echenid Empire.

### Pneuma
The Lacertian - and therefore Echenid - view of magic has a decidedly more spiritual aspect than the more scientific study of the Arcane Field found elsewhere. They view it as a living thing, called Pneuma, which means "breath" and "spirit". They see it as the wellspring of all life, and that which connects all living things. Pneuma has a will, which is complex and far-sighted, but rhudimentarily is believed to embody calm, stability, and oneness with the nature of things. It is not a diety, nor perhaps sentient, but rather a living force, or the collective organism that is all living things.

Technology that harnesses Pneuma is called Pneumatek, or Pneumatic Engineering. The role of an engineer - or pneumatist - is a spiritual one. Practitioners are trained at the Imperial Academy, often learning the craft from the dragons themselves. In addition to their mechanical duties, they also perform rituals and cast spells in the maintenance of their machines.

### The Circle
The Circle is a council of the most wise and powerful dragons; usually the eldest; in the order. The seat of their power is the Lacertian Temple on Echenodea.

### Lacertian Order Hierarchy
#### Hierophant
Lacertian Archons who are members of the Circle have the title Hierophant.
##### Current Hierophants (7):
- Arrephoros
- Basilinna
- Daduchos
- Gerarai
- Kanephoroi
- Panageis
- Plyntrides
#### Archon
Dragons who prove themselves wise and capable leaders are chosen by the Circle to become Archons. An Archon is a trusted and well respected member of the order, and can call upon the service of Knights to aid them in their designs. They answer to the Circle.
#### Lacer Knight
Knights make up the bulk of the Lacertian Order. They are largely autonomous, and can decide amongst themselves what quests they will take up, and what forces they will utilise. Knights may be called into the service of an Archon, and although declining such a calling is taboo, it is a Knight's right to choose.
##### Lacer Knight Specialties
There are several special vocations that a Lacer Knight may choose to take, who does not prefer the typical roles of prist, police, or general:
###### Lodestar
A Lodestar continues the work of a Scion after they have been raised to the rank of Knight, dedicating themselves to the understanding of other cultures. Some Lodestars spend their entire long life with a single culture that they feel attached to, in order to act as its advocate and protector.
###### Docent
A Docent leads a monastic life, dedicated to study; especially in a spiritual context, seeking to learn the ways and will of Pneuma. Lacertian Docents also administrate and run the Great Computer (library) on Echenodea.
###### Oracle
An Oracle is a Lacertian Knight who bathes in the sacred pools of the Erenede with the very Echenids themselves. In doing so, they enter a psychic trance, and interpret the strange and cryptic messages that are conveyed to them. The Oracles are excempt from the authority of the Circle. Over time, they become more and more different; more strange; as they become every more attuned with the will of the Echenids. Some rumours claim that there are no Echenids, and that the Lacertian Circle rules the Empire through its Oracles. But no being who has spoken to an Oracle has ever doubted their truth.
#### Scion / Squire
A young dragon apprentice dedicated to the service and tutilage of one specific Lacer Knight or Archon. Lacertian Scions are expected to spend many years - perhaps many decades - integrating themselves into other worlds and cultures, to learn their histories and cultural contexts. In Lacertian dealings with other cultures, dragons who served there as a Scion will be called upon to make decisions regarding an action with that culture, which only a unanomous vote of the Circle can override.
#### Neonate
An infant dragon, no longer a hatchling, who has begun their education and training in the Lacertian Order.

### The Great Computer
Administrated by Lacertian Docents and their myriad acolytes from various cultures across the Empire, the Great Computer is a library, and also the central economic planning tool of the Empire. Its databases are connected to education centres that are available everywhere, free to all, across Echenid Space.

### Dragons & Kobolds (by Trisha)
So I found a theme for the empire. Imagine a dragon disembarking flanked by 1000 kobolds, who fan out, in unison, and march as the dragon walks -- and sings. The kobolds then match the song and become the backup chorus to the dragon's main song, just as in this music theme.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rZlsad_hNQ&list=PLNa9WVTtQsF1V8sqv4SWibUQ9_96Eo3g1&index=4
I picture the dragon in long, flowing robes with strips that flow in the air, as if on an unseen breeze, the visual manifestation of their magical might. As if an unseen wind always surrounded them, They dwarf every being around them, and the ship's lighting follows them like a stage light. The kobolds sing with all their heart. The dragon's song is of peace and unity. It is overwhelming.

The dragon's own overwhelming magical power keeps the wind blowing, like the dragon is a tempest kept in check by its force of will alone.
Much in the sense seeing radiation is unusual and alarming, but in this way it's seeing magic visibly, but also, controlled.
You probably get the impression the dragon doens't need those thousand guards.
Like looking at a god for whom fire swirls, wind blows, and storms howl because they are there.
That's how I see them anyway.

I could see the dragons being all high level clerics with their domains representing what that dragon focuses on. The highest governing dragons possibly form a rcouncil -- called The Ring  or Circle-- and they embody whole ideas and are strong enough in their overwhelming presence and in the belief put to them to grant powers to others through that belief, like gods or demigods.

People very rarely see them in person. Even lesser dragons prefer solitude or other affairs. There's probably a few that do socialize, like the Minister of the Public Heart and the August High Peacekeeper.

There's probably a few that are high level ambassadors, they are serene, majestic, and imposing to a startling degree, like a gentle storm coming from on high to visit you, personally.

They are, they're generally decent. They tend to only intervene when a system poses a threat of great instability. They're kind of lawful good, aiming for serenity and peace, but they might be somewhat rigid and take a long approach to things.
Obviously they're not perfect. They make some people nervous, and they understand power and destruction just fine, They just prefer not to use it. Their show of might is to show they are perfectly capable of violence conquest, and defense, they have chosen to abstain from the first two, they use their power carefully and with thought.
Of course their thinking is difficult to fathom, they are high level thinkers and mystics, connected to the force of magic, and probably cybernetically enhanced and tending to a hundred tasks while maintaining their meditation.
It might be a bit like meeting a god machine AI in the form of a giant humanoid, the sense that while you're speaking to them they're on another level, they are condescending to speak with you not out of a desire to belittle you, but because they are something else entirely and you cannot meet them on their level and they know it.
There's probably only handful or two at that level though, there are lesser ones, still distant and imposing, but not quite so intense. The high level ambassadors are probably somewhere in the middle, as they take relations seriously.

### Kobolds
Kobolds, so named for being the diminuitive apex predator on their home world of Kobold, were technologically uplifted by Dragons, making them intelligent, for use as soldiers in the Empire's military. Myriad casts were created with different physical and mental traits. Lacer Knights can psychicly link with Kobolds near them, sharing sensory information, and enabling the dragon to convey orders to its Kobold soldiers.
