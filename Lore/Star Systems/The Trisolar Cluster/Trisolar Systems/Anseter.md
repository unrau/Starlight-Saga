# Anseter Powers
## The Chairs (The Ansetian Assembly)

No one leader rules [[Anseter]]. Instead, leadership falls to the committees relevant to the decisions that need to be made. When multiple citizen zones or interests must be represented - which is often - the chairs from all affected committees assemble in the Hall of Chairs to make decisions. A chair from an unaffected committee is appointed temporarily as High Chair to facilitate these super-committees.

## [[TSSA Quorum]]

The Ansetian Assembly selects three former committee chairs to sit for [[Anseter]] in the [[Trisolar Systems]] Alliance [[Quorum]]. These must be members of the Assembly in good standing, and are usually chosen from those popular with the masses.

Current members sitting for the [[Quorum]]:
