Leo's Run is a star system in the [[Trisolar Cluster]].

> # Summary of Leo's Run System
> Leo's Run is considered by [[Anseter]] and [[Freestead]] both to be an outlaw system. Once controlled by [[Anseter]], a coalition of settlements, ships, groups, and individuals waged gorrilla warfare for independance.
> 
> Their victory was won by a loss 11 years ago, where indepentants forces were massacred by the Ansetian Navy, but a reporter named [[Loramane Val'faan]] dramatically captured the events, and testimonies of many indepandant fighters and citizens, and managed to broadcast it throughout [[Anseter]] and [[Freestead]]. The Ansetian Navy withdrew due to public outcry, and each settlement and ship in Leo's Run now makes and enforces its own laws.
