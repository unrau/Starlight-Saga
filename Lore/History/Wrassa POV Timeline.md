### The history of the [[Wrassa]], from their point of view.

#### Pre-Severance:


#### What is the [[Dark Vector Node (DVN)]] Doing Now?
##### Awakening
This node was cut off from all other mind nodes and motiles of Wrassa, and left isolated for a thousand years, before a vessel finally stumbled accross it. The crew of the Dark Vector brought it aboard their ship, and deactivated the AF Nullifier that had imprisoned it. The node assimilated the crew and ship, and began its mission to make itself whole again.
##### Before Act 1
Wrassa has been attacking settlements and covertly abducting people to assimilate into its hive-mind. It brings them to a small private shipyard in [[Leo's Run]] that it has taken over. Others are being held captive, waiting to be fed to the Wrassa stomach once the [[Maws]] are once again connected to the Nodes.
##### Act 1
Wrassa has detected the Imperium's recruitment signal, and is tracking down its recipients (the players) so that it can locate the ships that disabled it 1000 years ago.
##### Act 2
Wrassa's numbers have been decimated by the players, and they are withdrawing to their secret shipyard base in [[Leo's Run]] to regroup and reassess.
