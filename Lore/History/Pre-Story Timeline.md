> For events prior to this, see [[History of the Imperium Timeline]].

[[Anas Ooma Veda]], 84th Star Emperor, in the 24076th Year of the [[Starlight Imperium]], ordered the construction of a mighty weapon to defeat the vile and multitudous [[Wrassa]]. This weapon consisted of a host starship "tower" section with several battleframes attached to the outside: the Corsairius and its Corsairs. The key to this weapon were quarantine devices that created Null Fields in space; preventing localised access to the [[Arcane Field]], and thus able to sever [[Wrassa]]’s various mind nodes from one another. Three [[Corsairius class]] starships were constructed, representing the Emperium’s core values:

-   [[Agency of Thought]], representing scientific knowledge and individual agency (Dialectical Discovery)
-   [[Might of Myriad]], representing security and stability (Secure Foundation)
-   [[Dream of Imperium]], representing long-term generaltional planning and the philosophy of [[Urutism]] (Far Thought)

Two years after their commission, in 24078, the Corsairius' were deployed.

[[Garlen Corivan]], Science Advisor to the Emperium, was selected to command the [[Agency of Thought]]. He selected his Corsairs from among the Emperium’s most talented scientists.

General Eminet Argosis, Emper Anas’ childhood friend and commander of the 1st Imperial Navy, was selected to command the [[Might of Myriad]]. She chose her Corsairs from among the Emperium’s most elite war heroes.

Silisone Trifer, president of the Social Builders Union, was selected to command the [[Dream of Imperium]]. Their Corsairs were elected by the union’s largest trades councils.

This plan was made possible by [[Garlen Corivan]]’s predeccessor as Science Advisor, Eleas Moon, who succeeded in his risky and genius plot to gather intelligence on the [[Wrassa]] by joining with it, and taking advantage of his own Dissasociative Identities to send information back to the Imperium. Among his discoveries were the existance and location of all 3 mind nodes of [[Wrassa]].

#### The plan of attack for each Corsairius was:

1.  Park the Corsairius outside the range of the AF Nullifiers.
2.  Deploy Corsairs, each equipped with an AF Nullifier simultaneously with other Corsairius’.
3.  Corsairs fight through [[Wrassa]] defenses, and deploy an AF Nullifier onto the surface of the [[Wrassa]] node.
4.  All AF Nullifiers activated simultaneously by timer.
5.  Attach remaining AF Nullifiers to Node as a failsafe.
6.  Corsairius flies into [[Null AF Zone]] to retrieve Corsairs. Crews enter stasis for the 2-year journey.
7.  Corsairs enter stasis, except for 1 at a time, on rotation, to protect the others, and monitor the [[Wrassa]] node.
8.  Corsairs dock with Corsairius, and enter stasis, for the additional two year journey out of the [[Null AF Zone]].

## The events of the three Corsairius attacks were as follows:

#### [[AGENCY OF THOUGHT]]:
-   Dispatched to [[Raengeis]] System to engage the nearby [[Wrassa]] node.
-   Corsairs deployed to node coordinates. T-84 hours until quarantine.
-   [[Wrassa]] sends a collosal force of motiles to intercept the Corsairs.
-   Long battle ensues, and four out of six Corsairs are disabled at different locations en route.
-   Remaining two Corsairs reach the range of the AF Nullifier in time for it to contain the [[Wrassa]] node, but a powerful blast from the node destroys one of the Corsairs.
-   The final Corsair reaches the Node, destroys its now dormant infrastructure and defenses, and places its AF Nullifier on the node itself.
-   The node is severed from the others, and reeling from the loss. It manages to infect the final Corsair pilot with its assimilating spores, but without access to the [[Arcane Field]], it cannot issue a command for the pilot to disable the AF Nullifier.
-   The final Corsair pilot, unaware he has been infected with [[Wrassa]] spores, sends the Mission Accomplished signal, and enters cryo-stasis, awaiting the [[Agency of Thought]] to pick him up.
-   Having recieved the Success signal from its Corsair, commander [[Garlen Corivan]] and her crew set a course for the node, and enter cryo-stasis for the two-year journey it will take to reach their Corsair.
-   During transit, a collision with a piece of debris sends the [[Agency of Thought]] into a spin. It never reaches its destination, and therefore its crew is never awakened.
-   Due to dwindling power, the power to the stasis pods of the sleeping crew are disabled, one by one, until only Commander Corivan remains.
-   One thousand some years later, the [[Agency of Thought]]'s automated systems detects the presense of the liberated node of [[Wrassa]], and failing to reach its Corsairs, the ship awakens its commander and sends out a recruitment beacon to select nearby candidates for new Corsairs.

## [[WRASSA]]’S COUNTERATTACK:

[[Wrassa]] had been developing a weapon of its own; a version of its extradimensional tunnels that would connect important worlds and installations of the Imperium with the core of a star. When the attack on its nodes was detected, [[Wrassa]] immediately deployed this offensive. The infrastructure was in place, but the motiles it wanted were not yet sufficient in number to carry out in full scale. Still, it was enough. [miniature Maw Mouths] were deployed and arrived at their targets protected by armies of motiles. Out of 17,602 targets, only 211 were destroyed before their stellar connections were made. The Emperium celebrated their victory, but mourned the loss of their Emperor, their shipyards, thousands of worlds, and trillians of souls.

# TWO MONTHS BEFORE START OF SESSION 1:

The [[Dark Vector]] - a starship designed to explore Null AF Space (Dead Magic Zones) - encountered an anomoly in a [[Null AF Zone]], brought it on board, and disabled the quarantine device attached to it.

The quarantine device they disabled turns out to have been responsible for the [[Null AF Zone]] itself, in that area of space, because the [[Null AF Zone]] for lightyears around vanishes when the device is disabled.

The device also disrupted the functioning of the anomoly itself, which awakens. It is a Neural Node of the hive mind entity called [[Wrassa]]. It assimilates the crew, who now share a consciousness with each other, dominated by the Neural Node of [[Wrassa]].

This Neural Node is one part of a greater organism called [[Wrassa]], which was cut off from its dispirate formerly-connected parts by the ancient [[Starlight Imperium]]. Now awakened, it has assimilated the crew of the [[Dark Vector]], and it seeks to reconnect to the [[Wrassa]] Brain, which is in another [[Null AF Zone]].

The assimilated crew had set a course back to civilized space - the nearby [[Trisolar Cluster]] - before the infection took root.

The only vessel known by the [[Wrassa]] to be able to travel in Null AF Space is the legendary Corsairius; ultimate weapon of the [[Starlight Imperium]].

The [[Dark Vector]] crew finds the auxilliary vessel that links to the various parts of Corsarius, but they are hidden. Their presense aboard the aux vessel awakens its protector, frozen in hypersleep all this time. The protector uses her power to send a message to those capable and worthy of piloting the Corsairius. The players must find the hidden ships of the Corsairius, with the protector's help, before the hivemind does. Once the Corsairius is whole again, they must confront the [[Dark Vector]]. The hivemind manages to find the location of their prison system (the search for this unknown location is a plot point; nobody has it; top secret of previous Corsairius pilots, who hid the coordinates in a puzzle of their devising) and send a transmission before they are destroyed by the players. When they players investigate the prison system, they discover it is awakening. If players wish to continue after this story, they must search for the clues they need to recreate the prison, and recruit allies to help them push the hivemind back into it.
