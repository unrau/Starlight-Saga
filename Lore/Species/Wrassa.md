A mutitalistic-symbiotic collective of various speces of fauna and flora connected to a governing hive mind.

See [[Wrassa POV Timeline]].

###### Motiles

An organism connected to the Wrassa hive mind is called a [[motile]].

Motiles that were assimilated from other intelligent life forms are still capable of independant thought, but they prioritize the wellbeing of Wrassa above their own lives. When separated from the hive mind for extended periods, motiles begin to exibit a fierce craving for connection to the Wrassa, and instinctually will take any action necessary to reconnect.

The Wrassa exploited a species of massive spacefaring creatures - called Eaters - that all shared a single stomach connected by extradimensional veins. Wrassa assimilated these creatures into its hive mind early in their mutual evolution, and they became a co-dependant symbiotic organism. Wrassa spread its largest Eaters throughout the galaxy, to facilitate the fastest possible communication between its motiles (and thus a more harmonious mind). Wrassa also had smaller eaters that they used to explore new systems and deploy weaponised motiles.

The Wrassa's body is comprised of various organs, all connected by extradimensional veins. Some organs exist in real space, and others in extradimensional space. These organs are:

-   Brain - single - real space

-   Networked neural structures that form a distributed consciousness.
-   Communicates with motiles in near real-time thanks to the Eater network.
-   Contains many Planck Stars at its core, as its power source.
-   Planck Star powers the AF Tech that creates an extradimensional shell around the node. This makes it impervious to all known weapons.

-   Neural Node - many - real space

-   Adds processing power to the hive mind
-   If a Neural Node is disconnected from the Brain for an extended period, it will try use its motiles (or assimilate new ones) to reconnect with the Brain.
-   Acts as a backup, containing all of the data necessary to grow into a Brain and reform the Wrassa if the existing Brain is confirmed to have been destroyed has become permanently inaccessible.
-   Contains a single Planck Star at its core, as its power source.
-   Planck Star powers the AF Tech that creates an extradimensional shell around the node, similar to the Brain.

-   Stomach - single - real space (thought presently to be extradimensional)

-   Collosal organ capable of digesting almost most any energy-dense matter.
