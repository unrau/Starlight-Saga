The Mothflower is a [[Necromorphic]] hive-mind entity whose spores germinate new motiles from exisiting life forms. The subject need not be dead for germination to occur, but the process is sufficiently transformative to the mind of the host to be considered [[Metamorphic Necrogenesis]].

#### Librarians
The Mothflower has a small fleet of ships that travel the galaxy, with motiles on board, who serve as librarians for the wealth of knowledge and memories contained in its myriad hosts. They provide this knowledge freely, but the Mothflower has something to gain from these voyages as well; they will collect anyone who wishes to join with the Mothflower. Some find comfort in knowing their memories will last forever, and seek out a Librairian vessel when they are near death.
