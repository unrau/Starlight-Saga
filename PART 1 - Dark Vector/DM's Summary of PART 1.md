## Summary:

A mysterious signal brings the players together to defeat a murderous pirate ship called the [[Dark Vector]], and solve a mystery that will grant them all access to a squadron of ancient mecha that can combine to form "Corsairius", a fabled hero craft said to have been the downfall of an elder menace. Once the mystery is solved, the players are contacted by a member of the remnants of the [[Starlight Imperium]], of which Corsairius was once the flagship. If you wish to keep the game going, players can uncover the greater menace behind the [[Dark Vector]], and work with the [[Starlight Imperium]] to recruit allies and save the galaxy from this returned threat.

## Chapter Outlines (OLD):

### Act 1: Acolytes
[[Act 1 DM Overview]]

- Characters hear news broadcast about the [[Dark Vector]] attacks and kidnappings, and receive mystery signal.

- Signal in character's heads leads them to each other ("Following the Signal").

- Players meet each other in a starport, and the signal source changes, pulling them all to a new location. If they check the news, they discover that a step on each of their trails was followed by an attack by the [[Dark Vector]].

- Players must choose between 3 available methods to reach the signal source, and work together to get the Captain's demanded payment or favour in order to secure a charter.

- Players reach the Corsairius and the message playing in their heads stops immediately upon setting foot inside. The [[Dark Vector]], however, is hot on their heels, and boards the Corsairius. The crew of the [[Dark Vector]] attack the players with perfect coordination and zero evident communication. There is evidence of someone else on the ship helping the PCs, and when there is only one left, this someone comes out and traps the final opponent in a stasis field. With the attackers defeated, the [[Dark Vector]] warps away.

- Players meet [[Garlen Corivan]], the Commander of the Corsairius, who was awoken from cryo-sleep when the PCs boarded the ancient capital ship. She explains that the ship detected a [[Wrassa]] threat and sent out a beckoning call to the pilots of the Corsairius' battleframe squadron. It was supposed to wake her then as well, but the procedure malfunctioned. Finding no living pilots, an automated recruitment beacon followed. The PCs were chosen as the best candidates within scanning range. Garund is horrified to learn exactly how long she has been asleep. She tells the PCs that the intruders were certainly inducted into the [[Wrassa]] hive mind, the [[Starlight Imperium]]'s ancient enemy. She tells them that, with its crew depleted, the [[Wrassa]] neural node aboard [[Dark Vector]] will replenish its members and attack them again, and they must get answers from their prisoner. Unsettling interrogation reveals that the crew of the [[Dark Vector]] had already erased their logs by the time the [[Wrassa]] took over their minds, and that the [[Wrassa]] found the Corsairius, following the recipients of the signal, to obtain the coordinates of the system where the Imperium had imprisoned the [[Wrassa]]. But they didn't obtain it, and her scans show the containment is still secure. She tells the players about the hidden Battleframes, and that they must retrieve them if they are to defeat the [[Wrassa]] and the [[Dark Vector]]. The rest of the crew in cryo-sleep had malfunctions ages ago, and Garund is the only one left.

### Act 2: Corsairs
[[Act 2 DM Overview]]

- Reporter [[Loramane Val'faan]] and Detective [[Ryen Ramiken]] each catch up with one of the players as they split up to find one of the Battleframes.

- Some players encounter obstacles to retrieve their Battleframe, but others find it easier. Easy ones go to assist with obstacles.

- News of additional attacks and mass abductions by [[Dark Vector]] is conveyed to players via reporter and detective and/or news broadcasts.

- Chapter concludes with Garund officially inducting the PCs into the Starlight Armada.

### Act 3: Vectors
[[Act 3 DM Overview]]

- Val'faan discovers a pattern to the [[Dark Vector]]'s attacks, and Ramiken discusses strategy with the players and Garund. The Dark Matter's stealth tech is advanced, designed to avoid detection by restricted systems in Dead Zones, and it makes tracking the ship impossible. By the time local systems forces arrive on scene, the ship is gone.

- Players split up to investigate all of the possible places the [[Dark Vector]] could strike next, as Ramiken notifies their local forces, and Val'faan warns citizens over a news broadcast.

- A ship similar to the [[Dark Vector]], but different, appears at each of their locations, and they each conduct a battle at the same time. During this fight, each player discovers a new ability of their Battleframe - that it mimicks and reproduces their own personal skills and abilities on a larger scale.

- Garund contacts the PCs. The [[Dark Vector]] itself has found the Corsairius again, and Garund is leading it in a game of cat and mouse. The [[Dark Vector]] is gaining on her, and she can't utilize the full capabilities of the Corsairius on her own. Once the players defeat their opponents, they regroup at the Corsairius and Garund tells them that their battleframes can combine into an Ultima Frame. The PCs fight and destroy the [[Dark Vector]].

### Act 4: Maw
[[Act 4 DM Overview]]

- Stuff

### Act 5: Wrassa
[[Act 5 DM Overview]]

- Stuff

### Epilogue:

- PC success leads and revelation of threat leads to many declarations of galactic emergency. With the Corsairius and Battleframe squadron being more powerful than any other known force, nations and organizations from the worlds saved by the PCs send support personnel to crew and staff the Corsairius. Ramiken suggests most of these will be token contributions and spies, but he is placed as strategic advisor, and Val'faan moves onboard and sets up a [[Radio Free Galactic]] newsroom. The ship's starcharts are updated. Garund remains in command, and she insists on maintaining the Imperium's policy of Freedom of Choice for its Battleframe pilots - the ultimate decision of how to proceed will be theirs.

- Personal moment between Garund and the PCs, where she shares her sadness at the loss of her people, the unfamiliar faces filling her ship, and the reemergence of their ancient enemy.

- Garund goes to the command deck, and notices that the display indicating the status of the [[Wrassa]] Containment system is blinking red.
