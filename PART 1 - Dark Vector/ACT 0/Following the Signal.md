The following combination of table rolls and Mad Lib will form the skeleton of the character's journey from the time they first received the signal, until the point where the player characters all meet at the signal source.

This is optional. A player can invent their own backstory, or keep it secret or vague, if they wish.

Crucially, one player must be chosen, or volunteer, for another set backstory. This character was aboard the famous luxory cruise ship [[Club Far Out]], when it was attacked by the [[Dark Vector]]. This occured before the Imperium's recruitment signal went out, but because of the radiation cloud around the ruins of the ship, and the safe-seal emergency survival shelter that the character has been hiding in, this character has only heard faint occasional glimpses of the signal, and only feels a pull toward the other characters when they get close to the ruins of [[Club Far Out]]. When the story begins, they have been sheltering there, waiting for rescue, for several weeks.

Then have the player choose words for the following parts of speech, like a Mad Lib:

ADJECTIVE
OCCUPATION
VERB (related to character's skills)
SIZE
ADJECTIVE
NOUN

Players may fill in the details of their journey, interpret their results as they wish, make changes, or leave it vague. If they don't like the generated content, they can choose or invent their own answers. It can be as important or unimportant to their character as the players wish.

I was [CIRCUMSTANCE] [LOCATION]when the signal started. After a while, when it wouldn't stop, I left with the help of some [ADJECTIVE] [OCCUPATION]s, and used my skills to [VERB]a [SIZE] [ADJECTIVE] [NOUN], and long story short, I ended up here.
