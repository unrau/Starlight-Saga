Story hook to share before session 0

Wherever you are in this moment, living your regular life, just like any other day, two remarkable things occur in succession. First, your attention is drawn to a nearby monitor, and the news story it is broadcasting. 

"Breaking news. Exploration ship gone rogue strikes again! I'm [[Loramane Val'faan]], on location amidst the ruins of destruction. This. Is [[Radio Free Galactic]]."

"Another day, another tragedy. Vacationers and employees alike on the famous resort asteroid [[Club Far Out]] were shaken awake this morning by a hail of weapons fire from the rogue ship '[[Dark Vector]]', as its murderous crew continues to haunt the galaxy, and our very minds. Over nine hundred confirmed dead, as the weapons penetrated the resort's plexi-dome, bringing the total kill count to nearly six thousand souls."

"Joining me now is [[IPF]] Detective Inspector [[Ryen Ramiken]], who leads the investigation into the nature and reasons for these attacks."

The inspector opens his mouth, about to contribute something, but the reporter continues.

"Ramiken and the [[IPF]] still have not been able to make contact with the [[Dark Vector]], and have yet to determine a motive or pattern for these attacks. Nor has the phantom ship's method of transport been determined, says Ramiken, quote: 'No Maw was in close enough proximity to the last two attacks to explain the short time between them.' Unquote. Ramiken also assured me that use of the [[maws]] will remain available to travellers, as no Maw has yet been targeted by the [[Dark Vector]]."

Ramiken is visibly annoyed, shuffles uncomfortably, and reluctantly nods to the camera.

"Stay tuned for updates to this saga as it unfolds."

"This breaking news segment is brought to you by Lisa's Treats. Treat yourself to Lisa's meal sweets, now with real meats! I've been [[Loramane Val'faan]], for [[Radio Free Galactic]], and you have been informed."

A graphic swipes across the screen, and another face appears.

"Thank you Lora, for that update. Up next, ancient conspiracy believers celebrate anniversary of mythical defeat of galactic boogyman."

The news of another attack is deeply unsettling. No motive. No pattern. A mysterious enemy, striking from the shadows. It could appear anywhere, any time. Will you be next to be visited by the shadowy silhouette of the [[Dark Vector]]?

The second remarkable thing occurs almost immediately after the first. A sudden wave of dizziness, followed by a ringing that pierces your mind, and sends you stumbling. The pitch and harmonics of the noise fluctuates in your ears, like a receiver being dialed toward a clear frequency. If anyone is near you, they don't appear to be suffering from the same phenomenon.

Then you hear a message. Distorted, but loud. And clear.

"The noble and mighty [[Starlight Imperium]] beckons you, Acolyte. Follow the song of the Ascendancy. You are called to rise!"

The signal playing in your brain doesn't cease with the end of the message. Instead it continues, and the voice from a long dead galactic empire is replaced by a cheesy sounding anthem. Which repeats. Over and over. And never stops.

When you are occupied, the music is in the back of your mind. You can ignore it, but you are constantly aware of it. When no task demands your attention; when you lie in bed to sleep at night; it fills your mind. Medical scans show nothing. Doctors recommend therapy. If you have friends, they notice you become reclusive, distracted. Wherever you are, waking or dreaming, you feel a tug toward a pinprick point in distant space: the direction of the music. You know, down to the marrow of your bones, that the ringing and the music will not end until you reach the source of the song.
