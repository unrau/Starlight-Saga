# THE RUINS OF CLUB FAR OUT

As decided in Session Zero, one player character has spent the past few weeks trapped on the ruins of the luxury cruise ship [[Club Far Out]], which was destroyed by the [[Dark Vector]]. The radiation cloud surrounding the ruins, and the secure-seal of the emergency shelter they have been hiding in, has prevented the [[Starlight Imperium]]’s recruitment signal from reaching them; and thus prevented the [[Dark Vector]] from honing in on their location.


> [!INFO] The Scene
> The MS Chiron is making slow progess in rescuing the survivors of Club Far Out. Hindering this progess are:
>- Paparazzi, who harrass medical personnel with click-bait questions, and hog the comm channels with live stream broadcasts.
>- Scavengers, who scour the ruins for valueables and ransom targets, mostly disguised as civilian vessels offering aid.
>- Actual civilian vessels offering aid.
>- Insurance Adjustors, who document the scene to avoid insurance payouts.
>- [[Interplanetary Forces|IPF]] and [[Joint Enforcement Bureau|JEB]] Agents, who argue over investigative jurisdiction.
>- Disaster Tourists, who get off on destuction and try to collect souveniers.

Addressing the player trapped aboard [[Club Far Out]]:

**It has been weeks since the [[Dark Vector]] attacked your cruise ship, ruining your vacation, and intruducing you to all the new smells you’ve discovered whilst being trapped inside one of the ship’s secure-seal emergency shelters. The source of most those smells are your fellow survivors - [[Tilapia]], a young human crew member on her first cruise; and [[Finerand Ironhand]], an aristocratic diplomat from [[Leo's Run]] on holiday with her brother [[Archibald Ironhand|Archibald]].**

**The noises and turbulence of the crumbling cruise liner have been a constant source of anxiety. Many times you have had the impression of a passing ship, or people on the other side of the shelter door, but with your comm unit damaged, you have no idea what's been happening outside of this room.**

****

**(noise at door, hear multipe people talking, red herring: its the other players. Door opens, nope it's scavengers. Take an action, then switch to other players)**

Addressing the rest of the party:

**It has been several months since the repeating and maddening transmission from the ancient [[Starlight Imperium]] began playing in your heads. Your journeys have brought you here, to the ruins of Club Far Out - recently destroyed by the Dark Vector - and the nearby medical ship Chiron. (introduce chaos of myiad parties and conflicting interests)**
