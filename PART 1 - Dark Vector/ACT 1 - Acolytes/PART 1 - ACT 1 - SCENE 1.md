# THE RUINS OF CLUB FAR OUT

As decided in Session Zero, one player character has spent the past few weeks trapped on the ruins of the luxury cruise ship Club Far Out, which was destroyed by the [[Dark Vector]]. The radiation cloud surrounding the ruins, and the secure-seal of the emergency shelter they have been hiding in, has prevented the [[Starlight Imperium]]’s recruitment signal from reaching them; and thus prevented the [[Dark Vector]] from honing in on their location.

Addressing the player trapped aboard Club Far Out:

**It has been weeks since the [[Dark Vector]] attacked your cruise ship, ruining your vacation, and intruducing you to all the new smells you’ve discovered while being trapped inside one of the ship’s secure-seal emergency shelters. The source of most those smells are your fellow survivors - a young human crew member on his first cruise, and an aristocratic diplomat from [[Freestead]] with her husband.**

**It has been several months since the repeating and maddening transmission from the ancient [[Starlight Imperium]] began playing in your heads. **
