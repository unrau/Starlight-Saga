## Summary
Player characters are drawn to each other by the mysterious signal, and meet at the ruins of the destroyed luxury cruise ship [[Club Far Out]], where one of them is trapped. A rescue ship is present outside of the radiation cloud that surrounds the ruins, and its captain offers the players the use of their protective suits if they want to assist in the rescue operation. The players quickly rescue their new comrade, but then the [[Dark Vector]] appears, and all of the nearby ships leave. The players must brave the hazards of the ruins, and best a group of scavengers , to reach one of [[Club Far Out]]'s auxiliary craft. The signal now strongly pulls them toward a new destination, and the message becomes even louder and more annoying. They use their new ship to reach the signal source: a skeletal tower-like vessel with the name [[Agency of Thought]] written on the hull in the [[Star Syllabary]]. No sooner do they board than the [[Dark Vector]] appears again, and the players have little time to prepare before its crew boards the [[Agency of Thought]] as well. The crew of the [[Dark Vector]] never speak, but they move and act in perfect uninson. After the players defeat the crew, the [[Dark Vector]] flees, the PCs are greeted by Commander [[Garlen Corivan]], who tells them about the [[Wrassa]] and the mission of the [[Agency of Thought]]. They learn the true fate of the [[Dark Vector]], that the node of [[Wrassa]] is free again, and why they must stop it. Act ends with a tease that if the player characters are to become Corsairs, they will need to retrieve their Corsair Battle Frames.
